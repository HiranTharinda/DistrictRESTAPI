## React Native Technical Test - REST API

I have already deployed this to Heroku. The mobile app is using that api to fetch geolocation data.

## Installation

If you are using Yarn,

```bash
yarn install
```

If you are using npm,

```bash
npm install
```

You need to create a file named _.env_ the project directory and add the **MONGO_URL**.

```bash
MONGO_URL=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.repux.mongodb.net/<dbname>?retryWrites=true&w=majority

```

To run locally

```bash
npm run dev
```
